According to the educaon policy of 1972, the government decided to upgrade the college to the level of the University of Engineering & Technology aer shiing it to Nawabshah. Consequently, the \ufb01rst-year classes were started at Nawabshah in February 1974.\n\nIn July 1976, this instuon was declared as an addional campus of the University of Sindh through an amendment in the Sindh University Act, 1972 and was headed by a Pro-Vice-Chancellor. The addional campus was eventually upgraded to the level of the university on 15th March 1977 through an ordinance. Later on, the Provincial Assembly of Sindh also passed an Act in this regard and named the instuon \u201cMehran University of Engineering and Technology, Nawabshah\u201d.\n\nAct in this regard and named the instuon \u201cMehran University of Engineering and Technology, Nawabshah\u201d. In 1980, the Government decided to shi \u201cMehran University of Engineering and Technology\u201d to Jamshoro and the campus at Nawabshah was declared as a constuent college of Mehran University; renamed Mehran University College of Engineering and Technology (MUCET), Nawabshah\". On the 7 August 1996, MUCET was upgraded to the level of a university through an ordinance and later through an act of Sindh Assembly and was renamed as \"Quaid-e-Awam University of Engineering, Science and Technology (QUEST), Nawabshah\". At present, QUEST is accredited by the Higher Educaon Commission (HEC), Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and is a member of the Associaon of Commonwealth Universies. QUEST is situated just outside the city of Nawabshah near the airport and is spread over an area of 457 acres on both sides of the Main Sakrand Road. Presently, it consists of three academic sectors. Sector-A houses the departments of Electrical Engineering, Computer Systems Engineering, Informaon Technology and Computer Science. Sector B houses the departments of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Basic Sciences & Related Studies, and Mathemacs & Stascs. All the laboratories of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Workshops are located in Sector-C. Whereas, the department of English is located on the \ufb01rst \ufb02oor of the old library building, adjacent to the newly constructed and fully equipped Data Center and Examinaon Branch located on the ground \ufb02oor near Sector-B.\n\nThe Central Library is located in between the mulpurpose hall and the hostels. This beauful, capacious building is fully equipped with all the basic facilies for students and is open 7 days a week. The departments of Electronic Engineering, Energy & Environment Engineering are located near Sectors A and C, whereas the Telecommunicaon Engineering and Chemical Engineering departments are located near Mechanical Engineering workshops. The Administraon Block is situated near Sector-C. All the stakeholders of the university, i.e., teachers, o\ufb03cers, employees, and students have the facility of an express electricity feeder to work with full peace of mind with zero load shedding in order to facilitate the students and teachers intra university transport is scheduled keeping the me of classes in mind. There is a well-planned residenal colony consisng of a substanal number of bungalows for the teachers and o\ufb03cers and quarters for employees. A constuent college, named Engineering College Larkano, was established at Larkano city in 2010.

As a result, environmental polluon causes a\ufb00ect all valuable environmental components like water, air, soil, fauna and \ufb02ora.\n\nThe e\ufb00ects caused by this environmental deterioraon are not limited to local areas but rather may cause impacts on the regional or internaonal level.\n\nProf. Dr. Abdul Nasir Laghari Chairman\n\nTo address the maers of the environmental deterioraon caused by the transportaon, urbanizaon, and industrializaon sectors, the new department \u201cEnvironment Engineering\u201d is introduced in Quaid e Awam University of Engineering, Science & Technology, Nawabshah. The graduate environment engineers will be able to understand, invesgate, plan, design and migate the factors causing deterioraon in the natural environment.\n\nbeen instrumental in shaping the department's academic and research direcon, fostering a culture of excellence, and pushing the boundaries of environmental engineering educaon.\n\nBefore his current posion, Dr. Laghari served as an Assistant Professor in the same department for thirteen years, contribung signi\ufb01cantly to the instuon's growth and development. His professional journey includes notable roles such as Deputy Director (Environment) at the Sindh Irrigaon & Drainage Authority (SIDA), Hyderabad, and Lecturer at the Instute of Environmental Engineering & Management, Mehran University of Engineering & Technology (MUET), Jamshoro. Throughout his career, Dr. Laghari has undertaken addional responsibilies, including chairing various departments and serving in administrave capacies, showcasing his versality and dedicaon to the \ufb01eld.\n\nThe department has highly quali\ufb01ed and experienced faculty members to teach environment engineering courses to impart in-depth knowledge in the discipline. The students will be provided with on-hand knowledge about the natural environment and engaged in state-of-the- art laboratories to learn and apply the same in their professional careers.\n\nSince Environment Engineering is a new department and is being spilt from the Energy & Environment Engineering Department therefore the majority of laboratory facilies will be ulized from those laboratories already exisng in Energy and Environment Engineering Department. The details of these are given as under:\n\nDr. Laghari's academic achievements are remarkable, including a Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering from Mehran University of Engineering & Technology (MUET), Jamshoro, Pakistan, a Master of Science in Environmental Resource Management from Brandenburg Technical University (BTU), Cobus, Germany, and a Ph.D. in Engineering Sciences with a specializaon in Environmental Engineering from the University of Innsbruck (UIBK), Austria. His research interests span a wide spectrum, from climate change and water resources management to polluon control and environmental impact assessment. With a diverse skill set and unwavering commitment, Dr. Abdul Nasir Laghari has authored over 30 publicaons, published in highly reputable internaonal journals, contribung signi\ufb01cantly to the advancement of environmental science and engineering. Addionally, he has played a pivotal role in preparaon of various schemes for SIDA, including the development of legal and regulatory frameworks for urban/industrial e\ufb04uent disposal, groundwater extracon, wetland management, capacity building of environmental management organizaons, establishment of environmental baselines, and environmental awareness programs for farmer communies, sponsored by NDP and the Asian Development Bank.\n\nTwo fully equipped computer labs are exisng to ful\ufb01lling the computaonal requirements of the new department. In these labs more than 50 latest personal computers are available and are connected to the internet and digital library. The students can access the internet free of charge. At the same me, the students can access e- books free of charge to these thousands of books through HEC extended facility.\n\nThe department has its Seminar Library with books on engineering subjects in general and Environmental Engineering in parcular. The Library has also enough stock of the latest Journals, research arcles, newsleers etc. the interested students and faculty members can have a copy of the same for educaon and knowledge.\n\n61\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "ProspectusBatch_2514.05.2025.pdf", "coordinates": {"points": [[868.5955200195312, 1557.9404296875], [868.5955200195312, 1592.638888888889], [902.6841666666666, 1592.638888888889], [902.6841666666666, 1557.9404296875]], "system": "PixelSpace", "layout_width": 1750, "layout_height": 1660}, "last_modified": "2025-12-26T15:50:19", "filetype": "application/pdf", "languages": ["eng"], "page_number": 63, "filename": "ProspectusBatch_2514.05.2025.pdf", "detection_class_prob": 0.553546667098999, "is_extracted": "true", "parent_id": "d9c9801d9942aaa8dcd0ca1735244a47"}, "page_content": "Combuson Unit, etc. are available.
